# Progress Log

> Updated by the agent after significant work.

## Summary

- Iterations completed: 0
- Current status: Initialized

## How This Works

Progress is tracked in THIS FILE, not in LLM context.
When context is rotated (fresh agent), the new agent reads this file.
This is how Ralph maintains continuity across iterations.
