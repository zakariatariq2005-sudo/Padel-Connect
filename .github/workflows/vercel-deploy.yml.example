# Example GitHub Actions workflow (optional)
# 
# Note: Vercel handles deployments automatically via their integration.
# This file is just an example - you don't need it for basic Vercel deployment.
#
# If you want to use GitHub Actions for additional CI/CD tasks, you can
# rename this file to vercel-deploy.yml (remove .example)
